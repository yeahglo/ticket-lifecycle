**Ticket Intake** - End-users create tickets and are identified by unique email addresses.
- Anonymous users can create tickets (Note: We set it up this way.)
- Create a general ticket for "Stephanie Harris" with a made-up email address
- Give it a title about how mobile banking is down and include details in the body about this urgent event

**_Due to the access level we assigned this agent, we can see all the tickets._**

**_All tickets have come in with a priority level set to normal. By adjusting the priority level, queue managers affect the ticket routing._**

**_For this example, we set the priority level to emergency because mobile banking is down._**

**_Since it is a business-impacting event, the agent can assign it to himself._**

**_The ticket wasn't routed automatically, so it went to the Default SLA. Queue managers can set that as they triage tickets._**

**_If necessary, the ticket can be routed to a specific Department. In this example, System Adminstrators are responsible for mobile banking so we assign it to them._**
